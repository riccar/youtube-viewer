/*

Use rem for sizeing and gapping since it scales to user's browser (html) font size which is 16px by default
Since 1 rem = 16 px, then 30px = 30/16 = 1.875rem
Another approach is to set html font-size to 10px to ease the conversion. So 30px = 30/10= 3rem

Use em for media queries sizes since elements inside the containers will escale in reference to the em value

Above analysis is loosing relevance since browsers are hiding the font size setting to favour the zoom setting which change the CSS reference pixel and the whole page will be zoomed including pixel length, “em”, “rem” and everything else too.
